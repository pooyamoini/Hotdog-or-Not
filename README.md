# Hotdog-or-Not
I was watching Silicon valley tv show from HBO and there was a scene that they built an application which was "hotdog or not" detection! 
<br/>
So I came up with that idea to have my own "hotdog or not" application.
<br/>
Therefore I used the deep learning approach to build this classification problem.
<br/>
Also, I used Tensorflow for the main framework.
